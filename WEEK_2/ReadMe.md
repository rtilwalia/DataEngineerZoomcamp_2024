This week I learned about ETL pipelines and how can you orchestrate them in Mage.
Technologies that I worked on-
1. Mage
2. Terraform
3. Docker
4. Google Cloud Provider

Some basic things to do before starting working on mage pipelines
1. Clone Mage repo from here - https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-zoomcamp.git mage-zoomcamp
2. Copy the .env credentials and make changes.
3. Run the docker compose
4. Change the .yaml file in mage
5. Start working with the pipeline
